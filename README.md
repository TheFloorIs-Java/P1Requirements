# Project 1 reqs

Full stack app

Primary requirements:

- Backend using a SQL database
- Javalin as our web framework
- Javascript as our front end technology
- While your project idea should be cohesive, adding in JS makes this SUBSTANTIALLY more work-intensive than p0. So, I recommend not making your projects much more complicated than your p0's.
- Whether you reuse, refactor your code from p0 or if you completely change your project idea is up to you. Use good judgement on if you'd like to start from scratch or if you'd like to make some touch-ups.
- Cohesive project idea fully integrating a user-friendly website interface.
- Follow the 3 layer architecture (web layer / service layer / persistence layer)

Secondary requirements:
- Logging to file
- Unit Testing for backend service layer
- Cloud DB on Azure
- API follows RESTful convention

Stretch goals:
- Backend hosted on Azure Virtual machine
- Frontend hosted as a static webpage on Azure
- CSS styling, multiple pages, nice user experience

# Tentative presentation day: Sept 19-20

Suggestions:

THINK about exactly what data the user should be able to see and well as what data the user should be able to persist. It's useful to design your API endpoints based off of the functionality that you need

You can start implementation as you learn the content (ie, i recommend experimenting with Javalin/Javascript/Azure as soon as we learn them)
